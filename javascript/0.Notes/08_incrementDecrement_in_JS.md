# Increment/Decrement
Increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. In JavaScript, there are two main operators for this purpose:
1. `Increment Operator (++)`: The increment operator adds 1 to the current value of a variable.

2. `Decrement Operator (--)`: The decrement operator subtracts 1 from the current value of a variable.



## Increment Operator (++)
The increment operator `(++)` has two forms: prefix and postfix.

- `Prefix Increment (++variable)`: In this form, the value is incremented first, and then the updated value is used in the expression.
```
let num = 5;
let result = ++num; // Increment 'num' by 1, then assign the updated value to 'result'
console.log(num);   // Output: 6
console.log(result); // Output: 6
```
- `Postfix Increment (variable++)`: In this form, the current value is used in the expression, and then the value is incremented.
```
let num = 5;
let result = num++; // Use the current value of 'num' in the expression, then increment 'num'
console.log(num);   // Output: 6
console.log(result); // Output: 5
```
## Decrement Operator (--)

The decrement operator `(--)` also has prefix and postfix forms, similar to the increment operator.

1. `Prefix Decrement (--variable)`: The value is decremented first, and then the updated value is used.

```
let num = 5;
let result = --num; // Decrement 'num' by 1, then assign the updated value to 'result'
console.log(num);   // Output: 4
console.log(result); // Output: 4
```
2. `Postfix Decrement (variable--)`: The current value is used in the expression, and then the value is decremented.
```
let num = 5;
let result = num--; // Use the current value of 'num' in the expression, then decrement 'num'
console.log(num);   // Output: 4
console.log(result); // Output: 5
```

### Notes
- These operators can also be used with variables of numeric data types, such as integers and floats, to perform arithmetic operations and update variable values as needed.

- Remember to use these operators with care, as their behavior can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used appropriately.
