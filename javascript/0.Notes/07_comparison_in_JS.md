# Comparison
JavaScript provides various operators and methods for comparing values and determining relationships between them. Comparisons are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of your code.

# Comparison Operators
JavaScript includes a set of comparison operators to compare values and produce Boolean results (either true or false). Here are some commonly used comparison operators
:
- `Equal (==)`: Checks if two values are equal. It performs type coercion, which means it converts operands to the same type before comparison.
```
5 == "5" // true (type coercion)
```
- `Not Equal (!=)`: Checks if two values are not equal. Like the equal operator, it also performs type coercion.
```
5 != "3" // true (type coercion)
```
- `Strict Equal (===)`: Compares two values for equality without type coercion. It checks if both the value and the type are the same.
```
5 === 5 // true
```
- `Strict Not Equal (!==)`: Compares two values for inequality without type coercion.
```
5 !== "5" // true
```
- `Greater Than (>)`: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
```
10 > 5 // true
```

- `Less Than (<)`: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
```
3 < 7 // true
```

- `Greater Than or Equal To (>=)`: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
```
5 >= 5 // true
```
- `Less Than or Equal To (<=)`: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
```
2 <= 3 // true
```
