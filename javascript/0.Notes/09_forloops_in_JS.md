# For Loops 
A for loop is a control flow statement in JavaScript used for repetitive execution of a block of code. It is a fundamental and versatile loop structure that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values, such as an array or a range of numbers.

### Basic Syntax
The basic syntax of a for loop consists of three main parts:

- `Initialization`: This is where you set an initial value for a control variable (often called the loop counter). It is executed only once at the beginning of the loop.

- `Condition`: This is a condition that is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues; if false, the loop terminates.

- `Iteration`: This is an expression that is executed after each iteration of the loop. It typically modifies the control variable.

Here's the general structure of a for loop:
```
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```
#### Example: Counting from 1 to 5
```
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // Outputs numbers 1 through 5
}
```
In this example:

- `let i = 1` initializes the loop counter i to 1.
- `i <= 5 `is the condition that checks if i is less than or equal to 5.
- `i++` increments i by 1 after each iteration.

## Iterating Over Arrays
One common use of for loops is to iterate over the elements of an array:
```
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'];

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  console.log(colors[i]); // Outputs each color
}
```
In this example, the loop counter i is used to access each element in the colors array.

## Infinite Loops
Be cautious when using for loops to avoid creating infinite loops (loops that never terminate). Make sure the condition in your loop eventually becomes false to prevent infinite execution.

## for...of Loop
In modern JavaScript, you can use the `for...of` loop to simplify iterating over iterable objects like arrays and strings:
```
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

for (const fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit); // Outputs each fruit
}
```
The `for...of` loop eliminates the need for explicit initialization and iteration expressions and provides a cleaner syntax for iterating over elements.
